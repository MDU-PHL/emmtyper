# Summary

Bacterial pathogen subtyping is a corner-stone of public health microbiology and epidemiology. By classifying bacterial strains at levels below species and sub-species, bacterial subtyping allows public health officials and epidemiologists to identify and track outbreaks, identify particularly virulent strains, and make decisions about vaccination programmes. As public health microbiology transitions to a workflow primarily based on genomic data, there is an increasing need for Bioinformatic tools to perform *in silico* bacterial subtyping. Such tools are essential to enable the carryover of vast troves of historical data and allow for a smooth transition to genomics-based public health.

Transition to genomics in public health.

Bacterial subtyping in public health.

EMM typing in GAS.

GAS epidemiology.

Prior use of emmtyper (Lacey).

Statement of need: what it provides: support for transition to genomics. Validated tool.
